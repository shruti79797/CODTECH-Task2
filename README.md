OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
Project: Desigining Finite State Machine using Verilog or VHDL in VLSI software
Objective:
The objective of this project is to design a Finite State Machine using Verilog or VHDL in VLSI software.Writing testbenches to test different states and transitions of the FSM.Simulate the FSM behaviour and verify its correctness.
Desigining a FSM using verilog in VLSI software involves several key activities.Here is a structured approach to this project:
Specification: Defined the problem and the requirements of the FSM.
               Determined the number of states,inputs and outputs.
               Created a state transition diagram or state table.
State Encoding:Assigned binary codes to each state.
               Choosed an encoding scheme:binary,one-hot,gray code,etc.
Architecture Design:Decided on the FSM type:Mealy or Moore.
                    Designed the state register to hold the current state.
                    Designed the next-state logic to determine the next state based on current state and inputs.
                    Designed the output logic to determine the outputs based on the current state.
Verilog Coding:Wrote the verilog code for the FSM,including:`module` declaration.
                                                             State declarations using `parameter` or `localpram`.
                                                             State register.
                                                             Next-state logic.
                                                             Output logic.
Simulation and Verification: Wrote a testbench to simulate the FSM.
                             Applied different input sequences and verified it.
